                  This open-source textbook provides a comprehensive exploration into the fascinating world of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. Designed for students, researchers, and enthusiasts, this book bridges the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, guiding you through the essential concepts and cutting-edge technologies that are shaping the future of intelligent robots.

                <p>
                  Our journey begins with the foundational elements of <strong>ROS 2</strong>, the Robot Operating System 2, which serves as the backbone for inter-robot communication and modular system design. We then delve into <strong>Digital Twin</strong> technologies, exploring how simulation environments like Gazebo and Unity are indispensable for developing, testing, and refining robot behaviors in a safe and efficient manner.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The book further explores <strong>NVIDIA Isaac</strong>, a powerful platform for accelerating AI in robotics, covering its simulation capabilities (Isaac Sim) and its rich set of ROS packages (Isaac ROS) for perception, navigation, and manipulation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Finally, we introduce <strong>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models</strong>, a rapidly evolving field that aims to imbue robots with the ability to understand complex human commands, interpret visual information, and execute intelligent actions in the physical world. The culmination of this learning is a <strong>Capstone Project</strong>, where you will integrate these diverse technologies to build an autonomous humanoid robot system.
